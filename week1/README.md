# Week 1: Basic Terminology

This is a lightweight introduction to everything we're going to do. If this section repeats what you already know -- skim it quickly instead of skipping, because it's always convenient when we have a shared terminology.

## Arduino
What is Arduino and how come a $1 chip sold in a $20 packaging became so popular?

Arduino is a micro-controller on an easy to use board, meaning that it's a no-soldering required, plug & play programmable hardware.
It's open source (very important in hardware), so it's easy to find its spec, build it and build for it
It comes with a nice [IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) that's full of examples for quick star.
It connects to the computer and powers up from USB, so no need for special adapters or trying to attach separate wires anywhere.
Comes with extensions, called shields, to add specific functionality (e.g., many motor controllers, or Bluetooth, etc).
It fits on a breadboard, which makes it very easy to play with and prototype, without the need to solder (permanently attach) anything. It makes hardware as flexible as software.

## Basic Electricity Terms
- Voltage, current and resistance

P = IV

V = IR

Name | Symbol | Unit | Unit Symbol
---- | -------|------|------------
Resistance | R | Ohm | â„¦
Current | I | Ampere | A
Voltage | V | Volt | V
Power | P | Watt | W



## Arduino Nano
![](arduino_nano.png?raw=true)

This is a diagram of the [Arduino Nano board](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-nano). It has 1 mini-USB connection.
The big chip in the middle is the Atmel ATmega328P micro crontroller, 8-bit RISC processor :smile:
It has a reset button (in the middle of the board) and 4 leds for generic use, power idicator and RX & TX.



![](arduino_nano_schematics.png?raw=true)
This is the schematics diagram for Arduino Nano. Notice that in the schematics, the connections do not align with the drawing of the board, becasue it's used in plans that show how things connect, and not in phisical layout diagrams.




- Cable color conventions
- Resistors & trimpots
- USB

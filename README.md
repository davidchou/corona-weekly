> The repo for weekly electronics & Arduino activities during #StayHome corona times.

This repository will include simple electronics and Arduino projects for making #StayHome less boring.
It'll be updated for as long as we're staying home to flatten the curve.


You should start with the [Intro](Intro.md) section, and then jump into the weekly projects.

> The repo for weekly electronics & Arduino activities during #StayHome corona times.

This repository will include simple electronics and Arduino projects for making #StayHome less boring.
It'll be updated for as long as we're staying home to flatten the curve.


You should start with the [Intro](Intro.md) section, and then jump into the weekly projects.




# Administrativia / TODO:
These are not to me, with future plans

- [ ] Week 2: playing a tune with the buzzer
- [ ] Week 3: building the hi-tech office nagger
- [ ] Week 4: Adjust pitch and interval with the knob:
  - [ ] Use the switch on the knob to move between pitch and interval adjustments 
- [ ] Week 5: Using the screen: draw the pitch/interval on the screen

# Introduction

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
- Text editor (Emacs rulez!)
- [Optional] Git: to fix bugs and contribute back, it's not necessary to participate
- CH340 USB driver (see below, in hardware section): https://www.elegoo.com/tutorial/Elegoo%20CH340%20Driver%202019.03.06.zip

## Hardware Requirements
> You should get all of it in the kit mailed to your addresses
> Except for optional componets

I plan on using the following parts:

- Arduino Nano (a clone, with CH340 and not FT232)
- USB mini cable
- USB power adapter (5V, 500mA)
- A breadboard
- Jumper wires
- RGB LED
- Rotary encoder
- Piezo buzzer
- Resistors (100K)
- Trimpots (10K-50K)

Fancier components:
- LCD
- Clock (spec wil be updated soon)
- Memory (will come up with spec later)

Tools:
- [Optional] Multimeter. Not mandatory, but it's always safer when you know how to measure.


## Time Commitment
- Like a long weekly meeting, 2 hours

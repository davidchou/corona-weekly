# Introduction

<<<<<<< HEAD
Before we can jump into the projects, we need to define a shared terminology, and also install the needed software. All the software is free. The electronic components this guide will use are listed below, and can be easily purchased online (like I did). 

All the projects here will be small simple electronics projects with a few componets and an Arduino Nano (a clone). 

# Requirements

##  Software Requirements
=======
## Software Requirements
>>>>>>> Adding intro
- Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
- Text editor (Emacs rulez!)
- [Optional] Git: to fix bugs and contribute back, it's not necessary to participate
- CH340 USB driver (see below, in hardware section): https://www.elegoo.com/tutorial/Elegoo%20CH340%20Driver%202019.03.06.zip

## Hardware Requirements
> You should get all of it in the kit mailed to your addresses
> Except for optional componets

I plan on using the following parts:

- Arduino Nano (a clone, with CH340 and not FT232)
- USB mini cable
- USB power adapter (5V, 500mA)
- A breadboard
- Jumper wires
- RGB LED
- Rotary encoder
- Piezo buzzer
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Resistors (100Ω, 470Ω)
- Trimpots (10K-50K)

Fancier components:
- OLED display
- Clock (spec wil be updated soon)

- Resistors (100K)
- Trimpots (10K-50K)

Fancier components:
- LCD
- Clock chip
>>>>>>> Adding intro
- Memory (will come up with spec later)

Tools:
- [Optional] Multimeter. Not mandatory, but it's always safer when you know how to measure.


## Time Commitment
- Like a long weekly meeting, 2 hours
<<<<<<< HEAD


# Quick start
You can familiarize yourself with the components, and check that the Arduino powers up correctly:

## Components needed:
- Breadboard
- Arduino
- Mini USB cable
- Jumper wires
- 470Ω resistor
- RGB LED (or normal LED, if available)
